Survival analysis with SurvivalBoost
=====================================

Introduction
------------

Survival analysis is a time-to-event regression problem, with censored data. We call censored all individuals that didn't experience the event during the range of the observation window. 

In our setting, we're mostly interested in right-censored data, meaning we that the event of interest did not occur before the end of the observation period (typically the time of collection of the dataset).


Importing the dataset
---------------------


We will use the The Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset as an example, available through pycox.datasets. This is the processed data set used in the DeepSurv paper (Katzman et al. 2018), and details can be found at https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-018-0482-1.

from pycox.datasets import metabric
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# %%
np.random.seed(0)

df_train = metabric.read_df()
df_test = df_train.sample(frac=0.2)
df_train = df_train.drop(df_test.index)
df_val = df_train.sample(frac=0.2)
df_train = df_train.drop(df_val.index)
# reset index
df_train.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
df_test.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
df_val.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# %%
# For each individual `i` in the METABRIC dataset, the target `y_i` is comprised of two elements:
# 
# - The column `event` where $0$ marks censoring and $1$ is indicative that the event of interest (death) has actually happened before the end of the observation window.
# - The censored time-to-event column `duration` $d_i=min(t_{i}, c_i) > 0$, that is the minimum between the date of the experienced event $t_i$ and the censoring date $c_i$.
# 
# In this dataset, we have 40% of censoring.

# %%
df_train["event"].value_counts()

# %%
# Using SurvivalBoost to estimate the survival function
# -----------------------------------------------------

# %%
# Here our quantity of interest is the survival probability:
# 
# $$S(t | X=x)=P(T > t | X=x)$$ 
# 
# This represents the probability that an event doesn't occur at or before some given time $t$, i.e. that it happens at some time $T > t$, given the patient features x.

# %%
# SurvivalBoost is a sklearn-compatible model which expect a dataframe (or array-like) input as X, and a dataframe with columns "event" and "duration" as y. This allows SurvivalBoost to estimate the survival function $S$.

# People treated with Chemotherapy probably have more serious stages of cancer, which is reflected by the lower estimated survival function. This is a reminder that the estimate is not causal.

# Let's now attempt to quantify how a survival curve estimated on a training set performs on a test set.
# 
# Survival model evaluation using the Integrated Brier Score (IBS) and the Concordance Index (C-index)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Brier score and the C-index are measures that **assess the quality of a predicted survival curve** on a finite data sample.
# 
# - **The Brier score in time is a proper scoring rule**, meaning that an estimate of the survival probabilities at a given time $t$ has minimal Brier score if and only if it matches the oracle survival probabilities induced by the underlying data generating process. In that respect the **Brier score** assesses both the **calibration** and the **ranking power** of a survival probability estimator. It is comprised between 0 and 1 (lower is better).
# It answers the question "how close to the real probabilities are our estimates?".
# 
# - On the other hand, the **C-index** only assesses the **ranking power**: it represents the probability that, for a randomly selected pair of patients, the patient with the higher estimated survival probablity will survive longer than the other. It is comprised between 0 and 1 (higher is better), with 0.5 corresponding to a random prediction.

# <details><summary>Mathematical formulation (Brier score)</summary>
#     
# $$\mathrm{BS}^c(t) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n I(d_i \leq t \land \delta_i = 1)
#         \frac{(0 - \hat{S}(t | \mathbf{x}_i))^2}{\hat{G}(d_i)} + I(d_i > t)
#         \frac{(1 - \hat{S}(t | \mathbf{x}_i))^2}{\hat{G}(t)}$$
#     
# In the survival analysis context, the Brier Score can be seen as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between our probability $\hat{S}(t)$ and our target label $\delta_i \in {0, 1}$, weighted by the inverse probability of censoring $\frac{1}{\hat{G}(t)}$. In practice we estimate $\hat{G}(t)$ using a variant of the Kaplan-Estimator with swapped event indicator.
# 
# - When no event or censoring has happened at $t$ yet, i.e. $I(d_i > t)$, we penalize a low probability of survival with $(1 - \hat{S}(t|\mathbf{x}_i))^2$.
# - Conversely, when an individual has experienced an event before $t$, i.e. $I(d_i \leq t \land \delta_i = 1)$, we penalize a high probability of survival with $(0 - \hat{S}(t|\mathbf{x}_i))^2$.
#     
# </details>

# <details><summary>Mathematical formulation (C-index)</summary>
#     
# $$\mathrm{C_{index}} = \frac{\sum_{i,j} I(d_i < d_j \space \land \space \delta_i = 1 \space \land \space \mu_i < \mu_j)}{\sum_{i,j} I(d_i < d_j \space \land \space \delta_i = 1)}$$
# </details>

# Additionnaly, we compute the Integrated Brier Score (IBS) which we will use to summarize the Brier score in time:
# $$IBS = \frac{1}{t_{max} - t_{min}}\int^{t_{max}}_{t_{min}} BS(t) dt$$
